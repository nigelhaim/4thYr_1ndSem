	- But sometimes our reason or beliefs in life are limited only to our box of preference therefore we failed to see the other side of the coin. 
- Rizal is not relevant if you are limited on your own bias

	- The church interfered to propose in prohibiting the reading of Noli me Tangere and El Filibusterismo (One thing is UST)
