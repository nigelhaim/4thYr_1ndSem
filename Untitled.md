The bar graph of the top 10 products of the Philippines, based on their average, shows that the country can generate supply to feed the Filipinos. The trend line also shows the growing production of crops, fruits, Meat, and Fish. The products indicate that the Philippines is self-sufficient and could achieve food security. However, the food and feed availability trends in the Philippines show that feed production is much greater than food production. The combined analysis could indicate that the exports in the Philippines are more significant, and food security relies on importing other products. The discussion paper of Tionco and Francisco (2011) also states that the country's rice self-sufficiency ratio is high; however, the Philippines still relies on imports. Their study also shows that the Balance of Trade line graph is lower than 0 from 1990 to 2009.
