I. Introduction

I am Nigel Haim N. Sebastian I grew up in the humble place of Puerto Princesa of Palawan. Despite of simplicity and minimalism, I am fascinated on the rapid changing world around me. As I continue to grow, I also seek further knowledge and always challenge myself to be outside of my comfort zone. Continuously striving to become the best version of myself. 

II. My Family and I

My parents chose a path of simplicity and resilience where I grew up. They formed me to become independent at an early age, and for the past two years I started to live alone here in Metro Manila while studying in UST. My brother just moved in with me this semester taking each other time to adjust since it is been a while since I have other people sharing a home with me. In the past my family has focused on learning not just academically but also skillfully. Despite of academic struggles, my parents honed my skills on other things that focused on how to go through everyday life. From doing chores for daily needs, to basic house maintenance like carpentry, to technical parts like fixing electronics and computers. It is hard for my parents to let go of me as such an early age, however they support me on my choice and in return I will always try to make them proud of what I have achieved. 

III. Hobbies and Interests

Skating is always being part of me. Whether I wear Roller blades, jump on a skateboard or slide through ice I feel freedom in speed and risk. It is part of my life to always take risks and the best thing skating taught me is always stand up after each fail when landing a trick/move. My father taught me how to skate on such an early age, it is one of my first physical activities rather than playing catch with him. 

As to my course in college, I grew fond of programming, I learned to play with computers after I learned how to read and write when I was in pre school. Apart from programming I also developed an interest in media arts particularly in photo and video editing, constantly fascinated on how cinematography and effects developed throughout the years. Gaming is the most addicting and the most expensive hobby. Exploring different kinds of games and how to approach in learning and improving them. It provides me tranquility and a temporary escape from the stress.

Lastly I love to play guitar particularly fingerstyle technique. I chose music as a way of relaxation and improve my focus. I don't have a background in music however I taught myself to read tablature and work my way to improve my skills.

  
IV. Life in UST

The first two years are in an online setting. It helped me to adjust on how competitive and how academically complicated the standards. At first I thought I can keep up my academic achievements however I realized as I progressed in my course it became more challenging. Despite the struggle, it has also provided me insights on my weaknesses and strengths. I also made new friends and understood how do they approach life as it is, I learned from these people and picked the ones I can apply to myself. Living alone and studying in this prestigious university has tested all of my limitations, abilities and what I learned back in Palawan. It also made me stronger and more noble at the same time. 

  

V. Why I chose Computer Science

Choosing Computer Science or computer related course is an obvious choice. Since I am curious on how programs and games worked on the background. At the same time I want to keep up with the rapid changing world of technology, but before I can keep up I need to learn the basics first. I believe this course could help me form the foundation I need for the knowledge in further understanding computers.
  

VI. Expectations for this Subject and Professor

I do not have big expectations from this subject. However as I progress through the semester, I look forward on different lessons and activities embedded in this subject. I hope it could teach me things outside my comfort zone, but not too challenging for us to and loose our momentum and focus on different major requirements like thesis. I look forward to further learn from the professor to help me further learn about the world we live in. 

VII. Myself in 5 years

After graduating I look forward to obtain a job related to the field of computer science. I hope I could achieve my dreams since childhood and continuously learn and improve my skills. I look forward to obtain the assets I need and venture out to different countries, learn from them and someday teach the future generation of what I learned throughout the years.
