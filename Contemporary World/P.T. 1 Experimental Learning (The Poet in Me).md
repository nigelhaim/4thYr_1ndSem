Raymond Farrel wrote a poem entitled Globalization

I am but a simple wordsmith  
Who sees the tentacles  
Of a great living entity  
Engulfing the nations of the world  
I hear proponents  
Of this creature  
Giving their reasons  
As to why  
This world must embrace this trend  
I hear opponents protesting  
And see them resisting  
And I am bewildered  
Concerned and uncertain  
Unable to see the black and white  
Unable to take sides  
For lack of understanding  
Give me understanding  
Oh God - I pray  
Because I do not wish  
To profit  
At the expense of others  
I do not want my taxes  
To be used  
In the exploitation  
Of the impoverished abroad  
I only wish  
To see a rising tide  
Lift all boats  
But I am still  
Only a simple wordsmith.

7. What are the sentiments of the author regarding globalization? 
	- The author struggles with the concept of globalization, portraying it as a living entity that engulfs all the world's nations. As much as the world should accept and embrace the concept of globalization, the author disagrees with it because of its disadvantages. The author exaggerates its effects of poverty, conflict between nations, different opinions, and the overall complexity of globalization. He wants to change the concept; however, all he can do is express his thoughts through a poem
8. How do these perspectives apply to the Philippines?
	- Sharing the same sentiments with the author about whether to agree or disagree on some concepts of the adverse effects of globalization. We may have promoted a free world; however, too much freedom has caused us to have a complex system similar to a house of cards. If one goes down, everything goes down. Also, as the lines of "I do not want my taxes to be used in the exploitation," one of the concepts of Enlightenment in Liberalism topics is the social contract theory of men. We agreed to this contract to be protected by laws; however, if these taxes are used for exploitation, then the history of corruption repeats itself throughout generations. 
9. Write a short poem about globalization. 

Are we? 

Are we United? 
Do we have rights? 
Am I really enlightened? 
There is so much might

Who do I work for? 
For myself or for others? 
I spend on what for?
I'll just climb the ladder

I do thirst for power
But on what means? 
Should I go further 
or just stare on the screen? 

Are we really united? 
I am just enlightened
