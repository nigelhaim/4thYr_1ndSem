- Groups developing code-breaking computations during 
- Watch the imitation game
- Lies in the outside rights for both hardware and software 

### The 1960s

**ARPANET Program Plan**

### The 1970s and 80s

- Encryption takes time and it is necessary. 

### Bottom Up approach 
- Mula sa employee pa akyat sa management

### The Systems Development Life Cycle 

### SDLC and the SecSDLC
- Event-Driven
	- Responed through some occurence or intrusion
- Plan-driven 
	- Planed out 

### Investigation 

### Analysis
- Is it outdated, updated? 

### Logical Design 
- Started the creation of Solution system 

### Physical Design 

### Implementation 
- Documentation is a must for everyone to review the application 

### Maintenance and Change 
- The longest and the most expensive 

### Security Systems Development Life Cycle 
- The difference is the identification of threats 

### Investigation

### Analysis
- Conducting preliminary analysis and implementation of the control 
- Legal issues that could create an impact on the design 
### Logical and Physical Design 

### Implementation 
- Kung ano inaquire and inimplement kailangan malaman ng mga personel 
-
